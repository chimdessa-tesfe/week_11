You and your colleagues have joined to create an AI startup that deploys sensors to
businesses, collects data from all activities in a business - from peopleâ€™s interaction to
the smart appliances installed in the company to reading environmental and other
relevant information. Your startup is responsible to install all the required sensors,
receive a stream of data from all sensors, and analyse the data to provide key insights
to the business. The objective of your contract with the client is to reduce the cost of
running the client facility as well as to increase the livability and productivity of
workers.
